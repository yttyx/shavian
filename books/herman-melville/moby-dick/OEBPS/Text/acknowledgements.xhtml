    <p class="note">• Public domain <a href="http://readmoby.com/freePix.htm">cover art</a></p>
    <p class="note">• The text was converted to Shavian using <a href="https://www.dechifro.org/shavian">Dave Coffin's scripts</a> with the addition of a Moby Dick-specific dictionary moby.dict created by me (yttyx).</p>
    <p class="note">• The epub has been tested on a Nobo Clara HD, and Foliate running on Linux.</p>
    <p class="note">• The Table of Contents was originally in Shavian, but compatibility issues with the Nobo e-reader (the Shavian was not being rendered) made it more practicable to use the Roman alphabet.</p>
    <p class="note">• This epub is not viewable on a Kindle e-reader. Something about the conversion to Kindle internal e-reader format caused any Shavian text of longer than a few paragraphs to fail to be rendered.</p>
